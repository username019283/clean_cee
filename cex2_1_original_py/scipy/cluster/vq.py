K-means clustering and vector quantization (:mod:`scipy.cluster.vq`)

Background information
======================
The k-means algorithm takes as input the number of clusters to
generate, k, and a set of observation vectors to cluster.  It
returns a set of centroids, one for each of the k clusters.  An
observation vector is classified with the cluster number or
centroid index of the centroid closest to it.

A vector v belongs to cluster i if it is closer to centroid i than
any other centroids. If v belongs to i, we say centroid i is the
dominating centroid of v. The k-means algorithm tries to
minimize distortion, which is defined as the sum of the squared distances
between each observation vector and its dominating centroid.  Each
step of the k-means algorithm refines the choices of centroids to
reduce distortion. The change in distortion is used as a
stopping criterion: when the change is lower than a threshold, the
k-means algorithm is not making sufficient progress and
terminates. One can also define a maximum number of iterations.

Since vector quantization is a natural application for k-means,
information theory terminology is often used.  The centroid index
or cluster index is also referred to as a "code" and the table
mapping codes to centroids and vice versa is often referred as a
"code book". The result of k-means, a set of centroids, can be
used to quantize vectors. Quantization aims to find an encoding of
vectors that reduces the expected distortion.

All routines expect obs to be a M by N array where the rows are
the observation vectors. The codebook is a k by N array where the
i'th row is the centroid of code word i. The observation vectors
and centroids have the same feature dimension.

As an example, suppose we wish to compress a 24-bit color image
(each pixel is represented by one byte for red, one for blue, and
one for green) before sending it over the web.  By using a smaller
8-bit encoding, we can reduce the amount of data by two
thirds. Ideally, the colors for each of the 256 possible 8-bit
encoding values should be chosen to minimize distortion of the
color. Running k-means with k=256 generates a code book of 256
codes, which fills up all possible 8-bit sequences.  Instead of
sending a 3-byte value for each pixel, the 8-bit centroid index
(or code word) of the dominating centroid is transmitted. The code
book is also sent over the wire so each 8-bit code can be
translated back to a 24-bit pixel value representation. If the
image of interest was of an ocean, we would expect many 24-bit
blues to be represented by 8-bit codes. If it was an image of a
human face, more flesh tone colors would be represented in the
code book.

def whiten(obs):
    """
    Normalize a group of observations on a per feature basis.

    Before running k-means, it is beneficial to rescale each feature
    dimension of the observation set with whitening. Each feature is
    divided by its standard deviation across all observations to give
    it unit variance.

    Parameters
    ----------
    obs : ndarray
        Each row of the array is an observation.  The
        columns are the features seen during each observation.

        >>> #         f0    f1    f2
        >>> obs = [[  1.,   1.,   1.],  #o0
        ...        [  2.,   2.,   2.],  #o1
        ...        [  3.,   3.,   3.],  #o2
        ...        [  4.,   4.,   4.]]) #o3

    Returns
    -------
    result : ndarray
        Contains the values in `obs` scaled by the standard deviation
        of each column.

    Examples
    --------
    >>> from scipy.cluster.vq import whiten
    >>> features  = np.array([[1.9, 2.3, 1.7],
    ...                       [1.5, 2.5, 2.2],

def vq(obs, code_book):
    """
    Assign codes from a code book to observations.

    Assigns a code from a code book to each observation. Each
    observation vector in the 'M' by 'N' `obs` array is compared with the
    centroids in the code book and assigned the code of the closest
    centroid.

    The features in `obs` should have unit variance, which can be
    acheived by passing them through the whiten function.  The code
    book can be created with the k-means algorithm or a different
    encoding algorithm.

    Parameters
    ----------
    obs : ndarray
        Each row of the 'N' x 'M' array is an observation.  The columns are
        the "features" seen during each observation. The features must be
        whitened first using the whiten function or something equivalent.
    code_book : ndarray
        The code book is usually generated using the k-means algorithm.
        Each row of the array holds a different code, and the columns are
        the features of the code.

         >>> #              f0    f1    f2   f3

         ...             [  1.,   2.,   3.,   4.]]) #c2

    Returns
    -------
    code : ndarray
        A length N array holding the code book index for each observation.
    dist : ndarray
        The distortion (distance) between the observation and its nearest
        code.

    of a situation where this undermines the accuracy of the algorithm?

       The initial k centroids are chosen by randomly selecting

    Parameters
    ----------
    data : ndarray
        Expect a rank 1 or 2 array. Rank 1 are assumed to describe one
        dimensional data, rank 2 multidimensional data, in which case one
        row is one observation.
    k : int
        Number of samples to generate.

def kmeans2(data, k, iter=10, thresh=1e-05, minit='random', missing='warn'):
    """
    Classify a set of observations into k clusters using the k-means algorithm.

    The algorithm attempts to minimize the Euclidian distance between
    observations and centroids. Several initialization methods are
    included.

    Parameters
    ----------
    data : ndarray
        A 'M' by 'N' array of 'M' observations in 'N' dimensions or a length
        'M' array of 'M' one-dimensional observations.
    k : int or ndarray
        The number of clusters to form as well as the number of
        centroids to generate. If `minit` initialization string is
        'matrix', or if a ndarray is given instead, it is
        interpreted as initial cluster to use instead.
    iter : int
        Number of iterations of the k-means algrithm to run. Note
        that this differs in meaning from the iters parameter to
        the kmeans function.
    thresh : float
        (not used yet)
    minit : string
        Method for initialization. Available methods are 'random',
        'points', 'uniform', and 'matrix':

        'random': generate k centroids from a Gaussian with mean and
        variance estimated from the data.

        'points': choose k observations (rows) at random from data for
        the initial centroids.

        'uniform': generate k observations from the data from a uniform
        distribution defined by the data set (unsupported).

        'matrix': interpret the k parameter as a k by M (or length k
        array for one-dimensional data) array of initial centroids.

    Returns
    -------
    centroid : ndarray
        A 'k' by 'N' array of centroids found at the last iteration of
        k-means.
    label : ndarray
        label[i] is the code or index of the centroid the
        i'th observation is closest to.
